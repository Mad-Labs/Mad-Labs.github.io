The Mad Labs organization is a comunity of crazy technologists working on experiments designed to push our software development skills into new spaces.

Our projects provides an open, collaborative environment for interdisciplinary exploration and debate. We are students, colleagues and professors in the same time: learning together and from one another.

We like to discuss our work, to network, and to develop ideas that will improve ourself through exploration and experimentation.
