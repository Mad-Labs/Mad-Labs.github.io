## So what is Jekyll, exactly?

It is, at its core, a **text transformation engine**.

The concept behind the system is this:

Starting with the contents, in form of **raw text files**

jekyll will pass them through a **converter (like [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown))**

and wrapping it in some **layout files** written with **[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki) template language**

it will generates a ready-to-publish **static website**!

### Why use a static site generator?

* **Simple to use**: No other configuration than static website hosting

* **Has Great Performance**: Pages are just HTML. No database calls, no complex layers of caching needed

* **Cheap**: Hosting is free or cheap and costs don't increase with load

* **Maintainable**: Minimal infrastructure to manage. Easy to start a project, or create a feature branch and throw it on a staging server
